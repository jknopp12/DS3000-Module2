    "The `ipynb` format stores outputs from the last time you ran the notebook.  (When you open a notebook it has the figures and outputs of the last time you ran it too).  To ensure that your submitted `ipynb` file represents your latest code, make sure to give a fresh run `Kernel > Restart & Run All` just before uploading the `ipynb` file to Canvas.\n",
